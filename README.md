# BD-pesterchum-classic-theme
A theme for better discord emulating Pesterchum 6.0 from homestuck

For the best experience, you should do the following:
- Install [BetterRoleColors](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/BetterRoleColors) to colour messages, works best on servers with a colour bot
- Turn on compact mode in Appearance > Message Display > Compact Mode (Best without profile pictures but that's up to you)
- Optionally, if you're on a server with pluralKit, also install [PluralChum](https://github.com/estroBiologist/pluralchum/tree/1.12) for the same colour messaging
